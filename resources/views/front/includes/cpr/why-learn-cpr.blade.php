            <p>
                Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, also known as CPR, is an emergency procedure which involves performing
                chest compressions often combined with artificial ventilation in an effort to revive breathing and
                restore oxygen flow to the brain and vital organs. This is done manually to preserve intact brain
                function until further medical assistance is available to restore spontaneous blood circulation in a
                person who is in cardiac arrest.
